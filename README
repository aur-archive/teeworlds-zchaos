Hi Tees, today I'll present you zChaos, the final version.

==== Description ====

zChaos is gametype mod, that includes bots/zombies.

The objective is to kill all the zombies, and different waves.

The mod idea is based on 0.5 zomb mod, however, all the code is original.

It counts with a Power Ups system, Power Ups can be bought votes, that start
by them-selfs.

Important note: It only supports 4 players/server.

Get more info. about the mod on iPod Forum Page or on iPod's Wiki

==== Differences between zChaos and Zomb-Mod ====

This Mod have no Red / Blue team, so you can use your personal skin colors

zChaos bots are smart, Zomb ones aren't, you can see zChaos bot types on the
link bellow

There is no need to run a vote to start the rounds.

However, Zomb and zChaos shouldn't be compared, once they work on a totally
different way.

==== Server Setting ====

This mod have no special setting, except the gametype, zChaos

==== Mod Devs ====

Pikotee
AssassinTee
